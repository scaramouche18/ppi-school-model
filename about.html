            <h3>School Overview</h3>
            <p>At PP International School innovation is the buzzword. We believe in learning things by gaining hands-on experience by doing, thinking, problem-solving, listening, talking, reading, playing, sharing, and role playing making learning a joyful experience.

The school supports an education system that emphasizes “Experiential learning”. The focus is on challenging the students to explore new ideas and hone their capabilities and skills. With well-equipped and state-of-the-art laboratories, the students are provided opportunities to question, explore, examine, hypothesize and draw inferences thus building a scientific temperament. At PP International School children are encouraged to forge ties with nature and our activities are designed to help students realize the role of sustainable development. We aim at promoting the psychological and physical development of each child by providing a suitable educational environment. This includes various educational activities centered on play. Our curriculum stresses on, a “Healthy life”, “Social life”, “Expressive life”, “Communication life” and “Enquiry life” to develop the social, intellectual, and emotional quotient of a child. Our classrooms and activities are designed in such a manner that they put a child at ease and stimulate learning. For us, it is imperative that the school be a place where a child is happy.

Today to meet the challenges and demands of the modern fast-paced world, students need to be techno savvy. We realize the importance of electronically supported learning and have classrooms equipped with smart boards to assist learning. Well-equipped computer studios with high end computers and ancillary printers and carefully monitored internet connectivity prepare our young learners for the IT driven world. The school also has a friendly online system that provides students, teachers and parents with information at the click of a mouse.

Every classroom, equipped with interactive Digiboard systems is a technology-enabled classroom where the classroom teaching is enhanced through the use of technology. The teachers’ computers in all smart classrooms are connected to a dedicated server engine which allows teachers to use the large repository of curriculum-based digital content in order to create a multi-sensory learning experience for the students.

PP International School is an institution that believes in going beyond academics and places special emphasis on extracurricular activities, which are crucial to the overall growth of the child. Music and dance lessons are a part of the daily routine as are classes in Theatre and Speech, thus ensuring that our students are confident and well-rounded individuals. Our belief is that there is a musician, a dancer, an orator, and an artist hidden in every child waiting to be discovered.

In Our unique initiative to promote all-round development of a student we have included Steady Steps Themes Gabriel International performing art classes as part of our curriculum. The School is a pioneer in this field and is ensuring that every child gets the opportunity to speak, dance and perform thereby overcoming their inhibitions.

Sports forms a very important part of our daily routine and every student is encouraged to choose and participate in at least one sport and students can choose from a wide array of activities. An indoor gym area with a climbing wall and Balancing Beam and special outdoor play equipment provide our young ones opportunities to have fun in a safe and secure environment. Our Play station area for kids is a unique combination of rubber granules and a cushioned layer surface with critical fall protection for children.

Microsoft Surface – A technology to reckon with has brought a paradigm shift in the way education is imparted. PP International School is the first Microsoft surface based school in PP International school.

We believe in providing World class heath care facilities to our students. In this regard we have as our partner the Max Healthcare Hospital, Shalimar Bagh that provides medical cover to our students. Recognizing that a child’s thought needs and behavior is different from that of an adult, comprehensive health care is provided to our students. As part of this endeavor we have a full time nurse from Max Healthcare Hospital and a visiting doctor who will take care not just of the day to day emergencies but also help students in problem solving, building self esteem and handling anger. In addition to that there are special schemes for our parents. Under the healthy neighborhood scheme our parents are issued cards that will entitle them to discounts on certain services. This also covers Senior Citizens.

The students are provided nutritious, healthy and delicious meals. The idea is not only to provide healthy meals and nourishment but also train the students in the basic etiquette of eating right. After they are done the students are encouraged to segregate the waste, thus inculcating in them the right ethos regarding hygiene and environmental sanitation.

We lay great emphasis on Value Education Programme. It helps children become aware of our rich heritage as well as values that are a unique part of our culture and tradition in a meaningful yet fun way.</p>
